* State-averaged and state-specific excited states,
* one-, two-, three- and four-particle density matrices,
* one- and two-particle transition density matrices between two states,
* perturbation methods including NEVPT2 and MPSPT,
* DMRG-SCF and/or DMRG-NEVPT2 interfaces to the Molpro, ORCA, Q-Chem and Molcas program packages. 

Calling `Block` as an external function
=======================================

The makefile distributed with `Block` code can be used to generate a library file called
libqcdmrg.a. 
To call `Block` as a subroutine from a C++ program, the library file has to be
linked to the program. 
A DMRG calculation can be performed using the function call ``calldmrg(inputf, outputf)``,
where ``inputf`` and ``outputf`` are C-style character arrays specifying the `Block` input and output fies respectively.

License and how to cite
=======================

`Block` is distributed under the GNU GPL license which is reproduced in the file LICENSE.
In addition, `Block` contains a full copy of the Newmat C++ matrix library by Robert Davies.

We would appreciate if you cite the following papers in publications resulting from the
use of `Block`:
